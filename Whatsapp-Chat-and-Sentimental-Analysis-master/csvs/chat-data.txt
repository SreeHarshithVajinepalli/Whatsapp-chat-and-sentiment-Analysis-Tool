If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones thatâ€™s the reason locked bootloader are better,pm,2020-05-06 18:01:00,1
